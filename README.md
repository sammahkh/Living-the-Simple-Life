## Description 

This is a 3-page website project from Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design Course on Scrimba.com. I watched Kevin build it and then I coded it on my own, the results of which you see here.

It was excellent practice in coding a layout with Flexbox. Learned some really cool things like pre-ordering flex items , Media Queries ,and Starting to think mobile first .
